# Image-Steganography

This is a simple tool for image steganography written in Kotlin. The tool allows embedding any given file within the least-significant-bits of an image and extracting hidden files from images. For now, only lossless image formats are supported (tiff, bmp, gif, wbmp, png). Lossy formats such as jpg will be supported later.
